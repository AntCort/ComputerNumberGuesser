# ComputerNumberGuesser
The Number Guesser Game is a Python application that challenges you to guess a randomly selected number within a given range. Through a series of interactions, you provide feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game dynamically adjusts the range and makes subsequent guesses based on your feedback.

How It Works
Run the number_guesser.py script. This script contains the NumberGuesser class and all the necessary logic for the game.
The program initializes with a randomly selected number within a given range.
As the player, you'll interact with the program by indicating whether the computer's guess is too low, too high, or correct.
The program will adjust its range and continue making guesses based on your feedback until the correct number is identified.
